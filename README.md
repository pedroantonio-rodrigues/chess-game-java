# Chess game in java
In this project, we created a system that simulates a game of chess, using the Java programming language to take care of the entire internal part of the application.

The objective of the project is to simulate a game of chess, in which the user can control the pieces on the board through the keyboard. Initially, the project was conceived to run in the terminal. However, I plan to develop a visual interface (front end) for the application in the future.

Projects Objctives: 
The main purpose of the project is to deepen the understanding of the Java programming language and the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.
